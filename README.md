# About

This is my first repository in Python, containing all Python projects that I have done.
Project themes are varied from math to simple practical applications such as:
    - to find the sum, median, standard deviation, etc.
    - to calculate the factorial, the Fibonacci series
    - to iterate some simple checks in the list with given requests like:
            . to remove the duplicate
            . to remove the vowel
            . to count the frequency of words
            . to find the longest common part in the 2 given strings
    - some simple games like:
            . battle ship
            . scrabble score
            . number guess
