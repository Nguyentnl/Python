# About

This is my first repository in Python, containing all Python projects that I have done. <br />
Project themes are varied from math to simple practical applications such as:<br />
    - to find the sum, median, standard deviation, etc.<br />
    - to calculate the factorial, the Fibonacci series<br />
    - to iterate some simple checks in the list with given requests like:<br />
            . to remove the duplicate<br />
            . to remove the vowel<br />
            . to count the frequency of words<br />
            . to find the longest common part in the 2 given strings<br />
    - some simple games like:<br />
            . battle ship<br />
            . scrabble score<br />
            . number guess <br />
